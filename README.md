🎬 Movie Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview
The Movie Recommendation System suggests movies based on content similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. It helps users find movies similar to their preferences.

🚀 Features
📂 Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to process movie features.
🔍 Finds the closest matching movie title from user input.
🧠 Computes cosine similarity to recommend similar movies.
🎭 Considers genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director.
🎯 Returns top 20 recommended movies.
📁 Dataset
The system uses a dataset named movies.csv, which contains essential information about movies:

Title
Genres
Keywords
Tagline
Cast
Director
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
NumPy 📊
Pandas 📑
Scikit-learn 🤖
difflib (for fuzzy matching)
